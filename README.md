# About me

Long before delving into academia, I've held a deep fascination for Nature and its incredible manifestations. The instances where I've questioned "why?"—whether directed at others or myself—are countless. Throughout my journey as a physicist specializing in experimental particle physics, I found a natural and convenient path to quench my thirst for understanding the intimate mechanisms governing our Universe. Now, I aim to broaden my horizons and transition from academia to the industry, seeking new challenges and opportunities to apply my expertise in practical settings.

I have been involved in several different aspects of research within the [CMS Collaboration](https://cms.cern/) at CERN.
